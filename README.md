ios-labels-matrix-view-swift
=============================

This is a very basic re-write of the original ios-labels-matrix-view (obj-c).

The original version was constructed using/arranging UIView and UILabels with NSAttributed string to create a grid like layout.
Quite useful for showing tabular data inside table cells.

The Swift version is lot more concise and was fun to work on.
Please leave feedback or requests.
